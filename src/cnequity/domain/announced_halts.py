"""Suspension sessions an issuer's own announcements state, for bar coverage.

While EastMoney push2 is unavailable a Shanghai halt has no first-hand status
row until Baostock catches up, about a week later; the only same-day record is
the carried board (``eastmoney_cached``), which cannot excuse a missing bar.
The issuer's announcement index already says when a multi-session halt began,
that it continues, and when it ends.

Only bracketed spans count: a session is a halt when it falls strictly between
a suspension notice and a later continuation or resumption notice for the same
symbol, each arriving within :data:`CONFIRM_WITHIN_SESSIONS` of the last. The
notice days themselves are excluded (a notice can precede or follow the halt
by a session), and nothing is extrapolated past the last notice. Advance
notices (``提示性``, ``直至终止上市``), one-day and check halts, risk-warning
halts, convertible-conversion halts and subsidiaries' notices never open a
span. Measured on the 2015–2026 lake this yielded 3,929 sessions over 555
symbols with no positive-volume bar on any of them.
